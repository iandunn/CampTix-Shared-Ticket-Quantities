simple ui for entering ticket ids. first n fields are ids, last field is total to share between them
   1,2,5,300
   3,7,8,750

or maybe metabox with checkbox walker
	have to keep them in sync across each ticket screen since not in a centralized place
	not problem as long as group together in data structure
		use camptix options field
		
save_post callback to save which tickets it's grouped with and the shared total for them
	
callback to watch ticket sales
	when new ones are sold, count the totals of all tickets in each group
		if a group reaches the shared total, close all tickets in the group
		 	don't adjust the individual totals in the database (which would be destructive), but find a way to just close sales without side effects
		 		maybe a new ticket status, but probably not
			maybe set the availability date to yesterday?
		
	prevent from overbooking. e.g. ticket A has 10 left, but shared total only has 2 left, and someone tries to order 5
		maybe filter the total left for all tickets in the group on the fly, but leave the original total in the database alone
			wouldn't want to filter it everywhere, just on the quantity dropdown
